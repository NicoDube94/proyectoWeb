      "content": "Can we all agree that the Federal Reserve has a plan to combat runaway inflation? They do. Chair Jerome Powell has all but admitted it. After tempering his comments before previous rate hikes, allowing wiggle room which gave way to market rebounds, Powell has left no bones about this one. It is necessary to wreak some havoc on the economy and put downward pressure on the labor markets and wage increases to stop the creep of inflation."

      "content": "According to the announcement, received USDC funds are instantly and automatically converted into the U.S. dollar (USD) at the moment of deposit. This new solution allows FV Bank users to send invoices to their international clients in USDC, enabling faster and cheaper transactions as well as conversions, the firm said.\n\n“We believe this feature will greatly enhance the user experience and open up more frictionless commerce,” FV Bank CEO Miles Paschini told Cointelegraph.\n\nPaschini pointed out that USDC will be the first stablecoin accepted for deposit into USD at this time, but FV Bank might consider more stablecoins in the future.\n\n“We have chosen USDC due to its licensing, reserve attestations and the real time 1:1 liquidity,” the CEO noted.\n\nApart from integrating USDC, FV Bank also plans to launch its own custody service in Q4 2022, allowing customers to hold digital assets in a custodial account alongside their depositary account. According to Paschini, FV Bank’s custody will support major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and other coins, “based upon our supported assets criteria.”"
